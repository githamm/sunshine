			<p>The mechanism for citizens to access information in Colorado is to file an open records request with the custodian.</p>
			<p>Colorado has several factors for determining if and when private information should be public; much of that has been determined through case law rather than a general right to access under state statute or the constitution.</p>
			<p>For instance, in Denver Post Corp. v. Stapleton Dev. Corp., 19 P.3d 36 (Colo. App. 2000), it was ruled:</p>
			<p>“Whether a private entity is a "political subdivision" for purposes of the Colorado Open Records Act is determined by considering a nonexclusive list of nine factors examining the level of a public agency's involvement with the private entity. The factors include: (1) The level of public funding; (2) whether funds were commingled; (3) whether the activity was conducted on publicly owned property; (4) whether services contracted for were an integral part of the public agency's chosen decision-making process; (5) whether the private entity was performing a governmental function or a function the public agency would otherwise perform; (6) the extent of the public agency's involvement with, regulation of, or control over the private entity; (7) whether the private entity was created by the public agency; (8) whether the public agency has a substantial financial interest in the private entity; and (9) for whose benefit the private entity was functioning.” The Colorado Consumer Protection Act, meanwhile, gives the state attorney general the power to release or withhold information about consumer complaints against private businesses.</p>

		<p>Some public records, however, do appear online. In 2009, a Colorado governor issued an executive order establishing the Transparency Online Project, which stated in part: “The Open Meetings Act and the Colorado Open Records Act provide Colorado's citizens with a strong expectation of accountability by providing open access to the state's public records and meetings. The advent of the internet provides new opportunities for state government to foster transparency and accountability.” A new transparency web site launched Jan. 1, 2015.</p>
		<p>“The TOP system is not intended to replace Colorado citizen's access to public information allowed by the Colorado Open Records Act,” reads a state government website about the transparency project. “Rather it is intended to reduce the time and cost associated with open records requests and to maximize convenience for state citizens in accessing state financial information. Any information that is not available in the TOP system remains available to the public in accordance with the Colorado Open Records Act.”</p>

		<h1>In practice, branches of government, state agencies and government officials do not claim to be exempt from access to information laws.

		<p>Colorado’s judicial branch is exempt from some aspects of the Colorado Open Records Act, based on a 2012 ruling by the state Court of Appeals that said the Colorado Supreme Court had decided that was the case in 1999. <a href="#" id="sunshine6-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine6');return false;">Show more</a></p>

		<p>“There’s a huge, gaping hole right now,” says Steve Zansberg, a media attorney in Denver who represents newspapers and broadcasters. “One of the three branches of government is not subject to our open records act by its own ruling.”</p>
		<p>This has stopped a background information company from getting certain records from Colorado’s judiciary, and blocked Denver’s NBC affiliate News9 from being able to find out how much taxpayer money a public defender’s office was spending on death penalty cases. The public defender’s office cited case law in denying the TV station open records requests.</p>
		<p>Beyond the judiciary, public officials are not exempt from Colorado's open records laws, according to Jeffrey Roberts, director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. But that doesn't mean they don't know how to keep a record secret if they want. One aspect could be the work-product exemption in the law. Before a bill is introduced, anything that goes into drafting or creation could be considered a work product and be exempt from disclosure. “There are things that they do that can be exempt, and a major aspect of that could be all the work that they do that goes into creating a proposal that becomes legislation,” Roberts says. In other words, there are exemptions in the law.</p>
		<p>Another area where exemptions cause hurdles to public access to information is law enforcement. "Records of official action,” like arrest reports, are generally public. But state law authorizes local police to decide whether to release a wide range of other records on a case-by-case basis, and to withhold them if they believe release would be “contrary to the public interest.”</p>
		<p>Another way a public entity might try to keep public information secret is by using an attorney-client privilege.</p>

		<p>The general rule is that any records that the government has that are associated with any contracting the government does with private entities is subject to the Open Records Act. “Those records are available, and there is an exemption for certain discreet categories of information,” says Steve Zansberg, a media attorney in Denver who represents newspapers and broadcasters in Colorado. <a href="#" id="sunshine7-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine7');return false;">Show more</a></p>

		<p>In Colorado, the public doesn’t always get information of interest when it comes to the private sector doing business with the government.</p>
		<p>Sometimes entities will exert an exemption, like a public hospital that didn't want to disclose salaries of its surgeons. That case went to the Court of Appeals where the ruling made the data public. “There’s very good case law that the government can’t simply promise to keep information confidential and on that basis alone withhold information,” Zansberg says. “It has to be confidential, proprietary and the disclosure of which would cause competitive harm to the private entity.”</p>
		<p>When it comes to government contracts and public service deliverability, contracts made “by any government agency involving the expenditure of public records are open to inspection under CORA,” says Jeffrey Roberts, director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. “After a contract has been let, the bidding documents of successful and unsuccessful bidders are open.”</p>
		<p>One recent incident that stands out involved a government transportation project that used a private firm partner, Plenary Roads Denver.</p>
		<p>In February 2014, the editorial board of the Loveland Reporter-Herald echoed citizen complaints and a “public outcry” about a lack of transparency involved in a decades-long state transportation project. “Considering that $425 million in tax dollars and public property are involved, the full 600-page agreement between the transportation department and the firm Plenary Roads Denver should have been released much earlier,” the paper said in an editorial.</p>

If it takes longer than that, a custodian can charge up to $30 an hour. The new law change is a bit of a double-edged sword. “In some places that's better than it used to be,” Roberts said. “Some governments took the opportunity to raise it to $30 when they were charging $20.”  <a href="#" id="sunshine9-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine9');return false;">Show more</a></p>

		<p>One recent example of a government trying to withhold information was when the Jefferson County school district denied an open records request to view the names of public school teachers who had participated in a sick-out at a school. The requester, Kyle Walpole, received a blanket denial claiming the names were part of a personnel file and contained confidential medical information. When a lawyer pointed out that the school district was improperly blocking the request under the law, the district agreed to release the names.</p>
		<p>Because Colorado doesn't have a centralized process for handling public records requests, “You have all sorts of different agencies and governments, and they all handle it in their own little way,” said Jeffrey Roberts, director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition. Furthermore, “We don't have training for records custodians in Colorado,” he said. This means responses to public requests range from very good to very bad throughout the state. “What I have seen are public information officers shooting off a letter with a denial that's … not very detailed,” Roberts said about the lack of public information training in Colorado's state and local governments.</p>
		<p>In 2013, two investigative reporters for Channel 7, the ABC affiliate in Denver, produced a series titled “Contrary to the public interest” that exposed the different ways open records requests in Colorado are handled.

And, when it comes to law enforcement, “the courts take a deferential attitude to decisions made by local [police] departments,” according to Denver media attorney Steve Zansberg. <a href="#" id="sunshine11-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine11');return false;">Show more</a></p>

Someone denied a request must seek a remedy in court. “If a government agency improperly withholds and the person requesting the records prevails in court, the agency must pay the requestor’s attorney fees, according to state law,” according to a 2013 investigative report by ABC 7News Denver. <a href="#" id="sunshine12-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine12');return false;">Show more</a></p>

		<p>State government in Colorado does not maintain a central or decentralized database that lists all government responses to public records requests. Some public entities, such as public universities, might choose to do it themselves, but they are isolated incidents, according to interviews. Colorado’s Secretary of State’s website states that agencies “may have different processes for open records requests.” That office, for example, states that information available in an electronic format can “generally be placed on a disk or emailed,” but if the information is not available electronically, “we will send paper copies to you by mail or fax.” <a href="#" id="sunshine13-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('sunshine13');return false;">Show more</a></p>
